# Using bubblewrap
*Bubblewrap is the tool that converts a pwa-homepage into a format that can be uploaded to Google Play Console. Using bubblewrap is very difficult, and on this page we need to focus only on how to install bubblewrap and how to use this tool (to create an aab-file).*

## Installing bubblewrap
The best way to install bubblewrap is globally, thats the reson it isn't included as a package in this app. Just install it globally with the `-g`-syntax:
```
// yarn
yarn add bubblewrap -g
```
