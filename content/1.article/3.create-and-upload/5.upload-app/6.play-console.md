# Google Play Console
When we have created the app with bubblewrap, then we can go on to `Goole Play console`. You need an google account to get access to the Play Console. Be aware of that publishing apps isn't totally free. To get lifetime access, you have to pay 25 dollar. Then you can publish apps the rest of your life, without paying anything. It's everything or nothing.
