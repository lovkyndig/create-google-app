# GitHub and Vercel
We need to push our local repo to github and then connect it to vercel. Than we have our app published on vercel. If the name you have set for your repo _"my-google-app"_ then you will find your app on internet with with this url (if you don't change it manually on vercel):

https://my-google-app.vercel.app

## GitHub
