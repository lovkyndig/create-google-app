# Content and configuration
Normally it's necessary to know html, css and javascript to build a app. That is not necessary for this app. The only thing you need to learn is markdown-syntax to write your content - almost like you write your content in ms-word or another text-editor. The configuration is a little bit more tricky (but there isn't much we need to do about it).

## Content

## app.config.ts and nuxt.config.ts
*The _app.config_- and _nuxt.config_-file holds the constants and configuration of the app.*
