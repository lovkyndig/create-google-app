## Open Source
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="GitHub"}
Programmers that love Open Source also love GitHub and other hubs where developers are publishing their apps.

This app is oopen source and therefore you find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

Clone it, download it or use this repo as a template for your apps, like I am doing. If you look in [my account on GitHub](https://github.com/lovkyndig), you will find that I have at list three apps that use this repo as a theme and template.

::::TabItem{name="Vercel"}
Vercel are giving the possibility for GitHub-users to host a public github-repo for free on Vercel. With a name like _Create Google App_, the url will be:
- https://create-google-app.vercel.app

Read more about the collaboration between GitHub and Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

## Base and futures
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="A base-theme"}
Like many of you: I'm not a css-stylist. I love a good theme and when I find one I'm not ashamed to use it as a base-theme, and then do the nesessary changes for my needs. Your welcome to do that, you to! 

I found my base-theme in the repo to [Benninbin](https://github.com/Benbinbin){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}, who had worked a lot to create a theme for use in homepages with big markdown-files, [BlogiNote](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}

Like Benbibbin I have also worked very much with my theme (God knows). That's the way its works with open source-code. Someone is copying your repo, working with it, and after a while the changes is bigger than the original work.

### Priority
- Add the site to [Ahrefs website-checker](https://ahrefs.com/website-checker)
- Add the site to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), and check if indexing-problems.
- Use [lighthouse](https://lighthouse-metrics.com/) to check performance, accessibility, beste practices, seo and pwa.
- Use Bubblewrap and add app to Google Play Console

### On available capacity
- Add [giscus](https://giscus.app/) - Follow this [tutorial](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/github-discussions-as-chat-system/).
- Add dark-light-themetoggle.
- Maybe add Google Translate option (not auto-translate).

## Going to Goole Play
::TabGroup

::::TabItem{name="Two challenges"}
Only God knows all the challanges I had to get my PWA works properly in offline-mode.

Going from a website on vercel to Google Play is a big step. I have worked hard to learn the modern way of doing it and have been stopped by many incredibly big problems along the way.
- First challange is how to get the app work properly as an **PWA**.
- Second challenge is how to use `bubblewrap` to convert the pwa to a "java"-app.
- Third challenge is how to get access to `Google Play Console`, and how to use it.

If you use this repo as a standalone-theme or as a template, then you don't need to struggle with the first challange. In this tutorial and guidelines I will try to learn you how to use; (1) bubblewrap and (2) the Google Play Console.

If you are familiar with github and vercel you can jump right to the last step in this tutorial about **bubblewrap** and the **Google Play Console**.
