## Open Source
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="GitHub"}
Programmers that love Open Source also love GitHub and other hubs where developers are publishing their apps.

This app is oopen source and therefore you find it on [GitHub](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

Clone it, download it or use this repo as a template for your apps, like I am doing. If you look in [my account on GitHub](https://github.com/lovkyndig), you will find that I have at list three apps that use this repo as a theme and template.
::::

::::TabItem{name="Vercel"}
Vercel are giving the possibility for GitHub-users to host a public github-repo for free on Vercel. With a name like _Create Google App_, the url will be:
- https://create-google-app.vercel.app

Read more about the collaboration between GitHub and Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

## Base and futures
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="Base"}
Like many of you: I'm not a css-stylist. I love a good theme and when I find one I'm not ashamed to use it as a base-theme, and then do the nesessary changes for my needs. Your welcome to do that, you to! 

I found my base-theme in the repo to [Benninbin](https://github.com/Benbinbin){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}. If you check out his [BlogiNote](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300} you will understand that his theme is my base-theme.

The changes or the futures I have added isn't in the style, except for the accordion style and all the collapsed accordions.

That's the way its works with open source-code. Someone is copying your repo, working with it, and after a while the changes is bigger than the original work.

I have added the futures I need, and removed some of his futures. Look in the next tab to see it all:

## Going to Goole Play
::TabGroup

::::TabItem{name="Two challenges"}
Only God knows all the challanges I had to get my PWA works properly in offline-mode.

Going from a website on vercel to Google Play is a big step. I have worked hard to learn the modern way of doing it and have been stopped by many incredibly big problems along the way.
- First challange is how to get the app work properly as an **PWA**.
- Second challenge is how to use `bubblewrap` to convert the pwa to a "java"-app.
- Third challenge is how to get access to `Google Play Console`, and how to use it.

If you use this repo as a standalone-theme or as a template, then you don't need to struggle with the first challange. In this tutorial and guidelines I will try to learn you how to use; (1) bubblewrap and (2) the Google Play Console.

If you are familiar with github and vercel you can jump right to the last step in this tutorial about **bubblewrap** and the **Google Play Console**.

[^1]: Prov from 02.11.2023 - version 1.0.1-rc.15.
[^2]: _((4 x 100)% + 98)%/5_ = **99.6%**.
[^3]: The bundle that is used for searching is normally created on generate. If you are using .playground (and want to test it there), you can use this command to create the bundle: `- npx -y pagefind --site .output/public --output-path public/_pagefind`. - Maybe you need to change `--site .output/public` to `--site ../.output/public`. NB! Offline-search ins't available.
[^4]: The style and the _find-next-btn_ isn't good, and this _"add-on"_ search-functionality isn't working in `Edge`, only on `Chrome` and on `Phones`.
[^5]: Most of the accordion functions are from [BlogiNote](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote). - style.css is added in assets-folder with style for the accordions. - All headers is collapsed and the Catalog (Table of contents) is closed on load, except; - The headers is not collapsed when using the search-functionality.
[^6]: Four packages from [d3](https://github.com/d3) is making this possibly. Which ones? See the _package.json_.
[^7]: All icons are downloaded and saved in assets/icons-folder. Don't try to use `nuxt-icons`, it will not work for layer 2.
[^8]: Most of my functions and methods are located in `plugin`-folder as helpers, and other is located in the `utils`-folder.
[^9]: If the notifications don't shows, changed the settings. Add the sites url in the `allow`-settings. - In Chrome: chrome://settings/content/notifications - In Edge: edge://settings/content/notifications
[^10]: Typescript-issues in my base theme ([BlogiNote](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote))-files are fixed and javascript is converted to typescript.
[^11]: Needs to be there because of [issues in nuxt-content](). The inspiration for the module is this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bloginote-copy-files-module).
[^12]: Privacy is mandatory for all Google Apps (and therefore needed in my apps). - privacy.txt.ts is added in server/routes-folder, and privacy.txt is added to public-folder.
[^13]: PWA is the first step on the way to Google Store. Remember to host your site ([vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github)). Se more in pkt 15 below.
[^14]: Bubblewrap has to be used to create the aab-package before uploading it to Google App Store. - Bubblewrap are installed Globally on the local mashine, for use on development, because; - I'm using bubblewrap in a subfolder under the root, because the bubblewrap are creating so many files that have to be keeped away from the github-repo-files. - Guide-folder with links and info about using bubblewrap is added inside the assets-folder. - bubblewrap-folder is added to .gitignore-file. [Read more](https://create-google-app.vercel.app/article/create-and-upload/create-app/bubblewrap).
[^15]: All public repos on github can be hosted on [vercel](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github) for free.
[^16]: The `bat`-file is copying the _dev_-files to _public_-folder (and then it's working). To run _bat_-files in **Git-Bash** write `./rss-sitemap.bat` + enter. 
[^17]: Vercel Analytics don't use cookies and this app isn't using cookies at all, therefore it's not need for a plugin that pop up with a question if you accept cookies. See the [doc](https://create-google-app.vercel.app/article/setup-and-deploy/deploy/verification-and-analytics).
[^18]: _google.site-verification_-file ([or code](https://create-google-app.vercel.app/article/setup-and-deploy/deploy/verification-and-analytics)) is necessary for indexing the pages in [google-search-console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about), before [Ahrefs website-checker](https://ahrefs.com/website-checker) can be used. [Read more](https://create-google-app.vercel.app/article/setup-and-deploy/deploy/verification-and-analytics).
[^19]: Added in version 1.0.1 as component with [@giscus/vue](https://github.com/giscus/giscus-component/tree/main). The `repo-id` etc. have to be set in `app.config.ts`. The following _regeg pattern_ have to be added to _navigateFallbackDenylist_: `/^\/.*\\?giscus=.*/`, to get it works properly.
