# Content and configuration
Normally it's necessary to know html, css and javascript to build a app. That is not necessary for this app. The only thing you need to learn is markdown-syntax to write your content - almost like you write your content in ms-word or another text-editor. The configuration is a little bit more tricky (but there isn't much we need to do about it).
 
## Content
Look on the content in _content_-directory, if there is content. If you are using the template, there shouldn't be any content. Then you can copy/past the content/folder from one of this repos:
- [Create Google App](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){:target="_blank"}
- [Nuxt3-pwa-offline](https://github.com/lovkyndig/nuxt3-pwa-offline){:target="_blank"}
- [BlogiNote](https://github.com/benbinbin/bloginote){:target="_blank"}

The last repo is the best repo with a lot of examples of use in the markdown-files.

## Template-related topic
*The _app.config_- and _nuxt.config_-file holds the constants and configuration of the app.*

Change the constants and configurations as you want.

Updating this content if I get respond on that it is needed.

## Pagefind search
The search-functionality on the website is from the `pagefind`-package.

If you not are using this repo as a template, you have to add `npx pagefind` to the generate-script in package.json, like this:

```json [package.json]
# Only on updating to a newer version of the app
"scripts": {
  "generate": "nuxt generate && npx pagefind"
}
```
 
Read the [`pagefind.yml`](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app/blob/main/pagefind.yml){:target="_blank"} and [`pagefind.playground.bat`](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app/blob/main/pagefind.playground.bat){:target="_blank"} [in the root folder](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){:target="_blank"} to get knowledge about using pagefind in `.playground`.
