# Verification and Analytics
After the first publication on vercel, we have to verify our ownership of the domain. This is requried if we want google know about our website. It maybe not requried to publish the app (I'm not shoure yet). Then we also want to use Vercel Analytics for checking visitors.

## Google Search Console
The verification process can start when we add our site in Google Search Console. 

There are several ways to verify that we are the owner of the website.
1. Download from Search Console a html-file and put it in the public-directory.
2. Insert a code into the `.env`-file that we we get in the Search Console.

### About the first method
The google-file to put in public is a html-file, who name starts with "google*"

## Vercel Analytics
I have already prepared for use of Vercel Analytics. The only thin we need to do is to start the service on vercel.
