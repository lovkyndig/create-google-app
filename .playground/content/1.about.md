## Open Source
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="GitHub"}
Programmers that love Open Source also love GitHub and other hubs where developers are publishing their apps.
This app is published [here on GitHub](https://github.com/lovkyndig/create-google-app){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

::::TabItem{name="Vercel"}
Vercel are giving the possibility for GitHub-users to host a public github-repo for free on Vercel. With a name like _Create Google App_, the url will be:
- https://create-google-app.vercel.app

Read more about the collaboration between GitHub and Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs/deployments/git/vercel-for-github){.text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}.

## Base and futures
::TabGroup
::::TabItem{name="A base-theme"}
Like many of you: I'm not a css-stylist. I love a good theme and when I find one I'm not ashamed to use it as a base-theme, and then do the nesessary changes for my needs. Your welcome to do that, you to! 

I found my base-theme in the repo to [Benninbin](https://github.com/Benbinbin){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}, who had worked a lot to create a theme for use in homepages with big markdown-files, [BlogiNote](https://github.com/Benbinbin/BlogiNote){:target="_blank" .text-blue-500 .hover:text-blue-600 .transition-colors .duration-300}

Like Benbibbin I have also worked very much with my theme. And that's the way its works with open source-code. Someone is copying your repo, working with it, and after a while the changes is bigger than the original work.

## Going to Goole Play
::TabGroup

::::TabItem{name="Two challenges"}
Going from a website on vercel to Google Play is a big step. I have worked hard to learn the modern way of doing it and have been stopped by many incredibly big problems along the way.
- First challenges is how to use bubblewrap to convert the homepage to a "java"-app.
- Secound challenge is how to get access to Google Play Console, and how to use it.
